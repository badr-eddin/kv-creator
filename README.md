The idea of this project is to create an ide for kivy python library with extra 
functionalities, but it looks like this is the end. So I decided to publish it

It is really missy and it doesnt have comments as it is my first personal real pyqt (and kivy) project.

*Functionalities*
- It runs kivy apps. Then embed it into the main window (PyQt6 Window) 
- an inspector of kivy structure, property editor, syntax highlighting and much more
- embded terminal (xterm)
- analyse and catch both python and kivy syntax errors (runtime erros excluded)


__If someone decied to try it, GOOD LUCK__
